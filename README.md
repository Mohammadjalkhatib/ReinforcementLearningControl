# QArm Robot Controlled by Reinforcement Learning Agent  
**Repository Name**: `QArm-RL-Control`  

## Project Overview  
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to autonomously control a QArm robot. The system uses observation, reward, and stopping mechanisms to optimize task performance. Experiments include training configurations, parameter tuning, and performance analysis.  

---

## Key Components  
### 1. **Observation Block**  
- Tracks robot state (e.g., joint angles, `Phi_dot` values).  
- Monitors errors for adaptive learning.  

### 2. **Reward Block**  
- Defines reward functions to guide the RL agent.  
- Example reward metrics:  
  - `Episode Reward`: Cumulative reward per episode.  
  - `Average Reward`: Smoothed reward over a window (e.g., 50 episodes).  

### 3. **Stopping Block**  
- Terminates episodes based on criteria:  
  - `Phi_dot` threshold (e.g., >1.7 rad/s).  
  - Maximum episode length (e.g., 300 steps).  
  - Average reward thresholds (e.g., `average reward=-1000`).

## Experiments & Results  
### Training Parameters  
| Parameter             | Value(s) Tested       |  
|-----------------------|-----------------------|  
| Max Episode Length    | 50, 77, 300           |  
| Average Window Length | 50, 77                |  
| Stopping Criteria     | 5, 77, 300            |  
| Sample Time           | 0.1, 1                |  
| Reward Threshold      | `-1000` to `1000`     |  

### Example Training Session  
- **Agent**: `IDOPOsAgent` / `rDOPCAgent`  
- **Episode Number**: 300+  
- **Duration**: ~4 hours (e.g., 04:19:25)  
- **Final Result**: Training completed after reaching maximum episodes.  

#### Sample Results (Episode 300):  
| Metric            | Value         |  
|--------------------|---------------|  
| Episode Reward     | 225           |  
| Average Reward     | 144.40        |  
| Episode QD         | 54.95         |

## Implementation Details  
### Reward Error Configuration  
| Max Episode | Max Episode Length | Average Window | Stopping Criteria | Sample Time |  
|-------------|--------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------|  
| 0.51        | 300                | 50             | 300               | 1           |  

### Training Workflow  
1. **Environment Setup**: Robot state tracking and error monitoring.  
2. **Agent Training**: Uses reward/penalty mechanisms for policy optimization.  
3. **Stopping Conditions**: Episode termination based on performance thresholds.
